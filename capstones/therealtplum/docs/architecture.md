# Architecture Notes

> **Note:** This document is currently a placeholder. For detailed architecture documentation, see:
> - **Hadron System Architecture**: `apps/hadron/docs/status/HADRON_STATUS.md` (comprehensive system architecture, pipeline flow, components)
> - **Project Scope**: `docs/scope.md` (system components, data flows, use cases)
> - **Service Architecture**: `docs/runbook_v2.md` (service overview, dependencies, ports)

This document will track high-level architectural decisions, diagrams, and reasoning behind:

- service boundaries  
- API structure  
- data modeling  
- caching strategy  
- ETL flow  
- deployment approach  

As the system evolves, diagrams and mermaid charts will be added here.
