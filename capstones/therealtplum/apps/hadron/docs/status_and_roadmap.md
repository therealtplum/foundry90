## Troubleshooting & Debugging Notes

### Polygon WebSocket Connection Issues

**Problem:** Initial implementation had connection closing after ~1 minute.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Subscription Format**: Polygon expects subscription params as an array of strings, not a comma-separated string
2. **Message Format**: Polygon sends messages as JSON arrays, not single objects
3. **Authentication Flow**: Need to wait for "connected" status before subscribing
4. **API Key Limitations**: Free-tier Polygon API keys may not have WebSocket access

**Solutions Implemented (Initial):**
1. ✅ Changed subscription format from `"T.*"` to array: `["T.AAPL", "T.MSFT", ...]`
2. ✅ Added array parsing for incoming messages
3. ✅ Implemented authentication state machine (wait for "connected" before subscribing)
4. ✅ Made error handling resilient - "not authorized" warnings don't break the connection

**Updated Implementation (Nov 29, 2025):**
Based on official Polygon/Massive.com documentation (https://massive.com/docs/websocket/quickstart):
1. ✅ **Fixed WebSocket URL**: Changed from `wss://socket.polygon.io/stocks?apiKey={}` to `wss://delayed.massive.com/stocks` (15-minute delayed, matches plan)
2. ✅ **Configurable Endpoint**: Added `HADRON_WEBSOCKET_MODE` env var to switch between `delayed` (default) and `realtime`
3. ✅ **Fixed Authentication**: Now sends `{"action":"auth","params":"API_KEY"}` message after connection (not in URL)
4. ✅ **Fixed Subscription Format**: Changed from array to comma-separated string: `"T.AAPL,T.MSFT"` (per official docs)
5. ✅ **Improved Auth Flow**: Wait for "connected" → send auth → wait for "auth_success" → subscribe
6. ✅ **Multiple API Keys**: Support for POLYGON_API_KEY + HADRON_API_KEY_1-4 with independent connections

**Code Locations:**
- `src/ingest/mod.rs` lines 22-46 (connection and auth flow)
- `src/ingest/mod.rs` lines 87-141 (message handling)
- `src/ingest/mod.rs` lines 99-104 (subscription format)

**Key Learnings:**
- Always check official API documentation for exact message formats
- Polygon/Massive.com WebSocket uses `wss://socket.massive.com/stocks` (not polygon.io)
- Authentication happens via message, not URL parameter
- Subscription params are comma-separated strings, not arrays
- Connection resilience is critical - don't break on non-fatal errors

### Database Query Issues

**Problem:** Initial use of `sqlx::query!` macro required compile-time database connection.

**Solution:** Switched to `sqlx::query` and `sqlx::query_as` for runtime queries.

**Code Locations:**
- `src/normalize/mod.rs` lines 145-164 (instrument lookup)
- `src/gateway/mod.rs` lines 81-116 (order persistence)
- `src/recorder/mod.rs` lines 80-95 (tick batching)

**Key Learnings:**
- `sqlx::query!` requires `DATABASE_URL` at compile time or prepared query cache
- `sqlx::query` is more flexible for dynamic queries
- Batch inserts are more efficient than individual inserts

### Channel Architecture

**Problem:** Need to distribute ticks to both router and recorder.

**Solution:** Used `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel for one-to-many distribution.

**Code Locations:**
- `src/main.rs` lines 74-76 (broadcast channel setup)
- `src/normalize/mod.rs` line 13 (broadcast sender)
- `src/router/mod.rs` line 8 (broadcast receiver)
- `src/recorder/mod.rs` line 8 (broadcast receiver)

**Key Learnings:**
- Broadcast channels are perfect for fan-out patterns
- Need to handle `RecvError::Lagged` for slow consumers
- Broadcast channels have bounded capacity - size appropriately

### Compilation Issues

**Problems Encountered:**
1. Router name conflict with Axum Router
2. Missing trait imports for tracing
3. Type mismatches with broadcast channels

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Used `Router as AxumRouter` import alias
2. ✅ Added `tracing_subscriber::prelude::*` import
3. ✅ Updated all channel types consistently

**Key Learnings:**
- Name conflicts are common with common names like "Router"
- Always check trait imports for extension methods
- Type consistency across channel boundaries is critical

## Things to Keep in Mind

### 1. Polygon API Plan & WebSocket Configuration

**Current Polygon Plan Includes:**
- ✅ All US Stocks Tickers
- ✅ Unlimited API Calls
- ✅ 5 Years Historical Data
- ✅ 100% Market Coverage
- ✅ **15-minute Delayed Data** (not real-time)
- ✅ Unlimited File Downloads
- ✅ Reference Data
- ✅ Corporate Actions
- ✅ Technical Indicators
- ✅ Minute Aggregates
- ✅ **WebSockets** (delayed endpoint)
- ✅ Snapshot
- ✅ Second Aggregates

**WebSocket Configuration:**
- **Default**: `wss://delayed.massive.com/stocks` (15-minute delayed, matches current plan)
- **Real-time**: `wss://socket.massive.com/stocks` (requires real-time plan upgrade)
- **Environment Variable**: `HADRON_WEBSOCKET_MODE=delayed` (default) or `HADRON_WEBSOCKET_MODE=realtime`

**Current State:**
- System configured to use delayed WebSocket endpoint by default
- Multiple API keys supported (POLYGON_API_KEY + HADRON_API_KEY_1-4)
- "not authorized" errors may occur if subscription format is incorrect or API key lacks specific permissions
- System is resilient and continues running despite subscription errors

**Action Items:**
- Monitor Polygon subscription status and error messages
- Verify subscription format matches Polygon's requirements
- If upgrading to real-time plan, set `HADRON_WEBSOCKET_MODE=realtime`

### 2. Market Hours

**Important:**
- Real-time data only flows during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- System will connect but receive no data outside market hours
- Consider adding market hours detection logic

**Future Enhancement:**
- Add market hours calendar
- Pause subscriptions outside trading hours
- Queue messages for processing when market opens

### 3. Database Performance

**Current Implementation:**
- Batched writes (100 ticks per batch)
- Individual inserts for orders (could be optimized)

**Considerations:**
- Monitor database load as tick volume increases
- Consider connection pooling tuning
- May need to partition `hadron_ticks` table by date for large volumes

### 4. Memory Management

**Current State:**
- Symbol cache in normalizer (unbounded - could grow large)
- Price history in instrument state (limited to 5 ticks for SMA)
- Channel buffers are bounded (10,000 for ticks, 1,000 for decisions)

**Watch For:**
- Memory growth with many instruments
- Channel backpressure if consumers are slow
- Cache eviction strategy may be needed

### 5. Error Handling Philosophy

**Current Approach:**
- Non-fatal errors are logged but don't break the pipeline
- Fatal errors (auth failures) break the connection and trigger reconnect
- Each component handles its own errors independently

**Benefits:**
- System is resilient to transient failures
- One slow component doesn't block others
- Easy to debug with comprehensive logging

### 6. Simulation Mode

**Current Implementation:**
- All orders are immediately "filled" at placeholder prices
- No real venue integration yet
- Orders are logged to database for audit

**Important:**
- Always verify `HADRON_SIMULATION_MODE=true` in development
- Real venue integration will require additional testing
- Order gateway needs risk checks before going live

4. **Code Organization**
   - Some modules are getting large
   - Could benefit from more abstraction
   - Test coverage is zero

---

## Architecture Decisions & Rationale

### Why Separate Service?
**Decision:** Hadron is a separate Rust service, not integrated into `rust-api`.

**Rationale:**
- Keeps real-time responsibilities separate from REST API
- Easier to scale independently
- Avoids turning rust-api into a "God service"
- Clear separation of concerns

### Why In-Process Channels?
**Decision:** Use Tokio channels instead of message broker (NATS/Kafka).

**Rationale:**
- Simpler for MVP - fewer moving parts
- Lower latency (no network overhead)
- Easier to debug and test
- Can evolve to broker later if needed

### Why Single Shard Initially?
**Decision:** Start with one shard, add multi-shard later.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler to implement and debug
- Validates core pipeline first
- Multi-shard adds complexity (coordination, state)
- Can scale horizontally when needed

### Why Simulation Mode First?
**Decision:** Implement simulation before real venue integration.

**Rationale:**
- Safe development and testing
- No risk of sending real orders
- Validates full pipeline without external dependencies
- Easy to test strategies and logic

### Why Broadcast Channels for Ticks?
**Decision:** Use broadcast channels to distribute ticks to router and recorder.

**Rationale:**
- Natural fan-out pattern
- Both consumers get all ticks
- Efficient (no duplication of data)
- Handles slow consumers gracefully (lag tracking)

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Posture

**API Keys:**
- ✅ Stored in environment variables
- ✅ Not committed to repository
- ✅ Rotated via `.env` file

**Database:**
- ✅ Connection string in environment
- ✅ Local development uses Docker (isolated)
- ⚠️ Production will need SSL/TLS

**Network:**
- ✅ Health endpoint is internal (Docker network)
- ⚠️ No authentication on health endpoint (add for production)
- ⚠️ WebSocket connections are unencrypted (consider WSS)

### Future Security Enhancements

1. **API Authentication**
   - Add API keys for health/metrics endpoints
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request signing

2. **Order Security**
   - Encrypt order data in transit
   - Sign orders before sending to venues
   - Implement order replay protection

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all order intents and executions
   - Track all strategy decisions
   - Maintain immutable audit trail

---

## Deployment & Operations

### Current Deployment

**Local Development:**
- Docker Compose orchestration
- All services in same network
- Environment variables from `.env`
- Logs via `docker compose logs`

**Production Considerations:**
- Need managed Postgres (Supabase or similar)
- Need managed Redis (for caching)
- Need container orchestration (Kubernetes/ECS)
- Need monitoring and alerting
- Need log aggregation

### Operational Procedures

**Starting Hadron:**
```bash
docker compose up -d hadron
```

**Checking Status:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/system/health
docker compose logs hadron --tail 50
```

**Restarting:**
```bash
docker compose restart hadron
```

**Viewing Database:**
```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U app -d fmhub
```
