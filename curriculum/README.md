# Foundry90 Curriculum

Welcome to the **Foundry90 Curriculum** — a 90-day systems engineering program designed to take you from “intermediate but scattered” to “full-stack, platform-capable, systems-literate engineer.”

This folder contains the **complete educational side** of the program:

- what you will learn  
- how the program is structured  
- weekly exercises  
- readings  
- architecture plans  
- evaluation rubric  
- the capstone project  

The curriculum is **technology-agnostic**, but the reference implementation uses:

- Next.js (frontend)  
- Rust + Axum (backend)  
- Python (ETL)  
- Postgres + Redis (storage & caching)  
- Docker / AWS (deploy)  

You are free to follow the exact stack or modify it.

## 🚀 Start Here

1. Read **`prerequisites.md`**  
2. Then read **`01_overview_and_syllabus.md`** carefully  
3. Then follow the weekly exercises in **`03_weekly_exercises.md`**  
4. Build your capstone in `capstones/<your-name>`  
5. Use the **rubric** to track progress  

Foundry90 is self-paced — but most learners aim for 90 days.

## 🧭 Philosophy

Foundry90 teaches:

- technical breadth  
- interoperability of systems  
- judgment and trade-offs  
- not “tutorial-following,” but **architecture and execution**

You are encouraged to treat this like a real engineering project.
