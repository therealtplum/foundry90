# Foundry90 – Self-Evaluation Rubric

This rubric helps you measure your progression throughout the 90-day program.

Score each dimension from **1–4**:

1. **Beginner**  
2. **Intermediate**  
3. **Advanced**  
4. **Elite**

Re-score yourself every 1–2 weeks.

# Dimensions

1. **Languages & Core Tech** (Rust, Python, TS, SQL, Swift)  
2. **Web / Frontend** (Next.js, TS, UI structure)  
3. **Backend / Services** (Rust API, Python ETL)  
4. **Data & DB** (Postgres, schema design)  
5. **DevOps & Deployment** (Docker, AWS, Vercel)  
6. **Observability & Ops** (logging, metrics, alerts)  
7. **Architecture & Judgment** (design, trade-offs)  
8. **Execution & Hygiene** (repo quality, docs, structure)

# Using the rubric

Every week ask yourself:

- “Where am I today?”  
- “Where do I want to be in two weeks?”  
- “What concrete thing can I build this week to level up one dimension?”  

The target by Day 90:

- **Languages: 3**  
- **Frontend: 3**  
- **Backend: 3**  
- **DB: 3**  
- **DevOps: 2–3**  
- **Observability: 2–3**  
- **Architecture: 3**  
- **Hygiene: 3**
