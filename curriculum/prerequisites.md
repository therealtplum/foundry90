# Foundry90 – Prerequisites

Foundry90 is a 90-day systems engineering program designed to help you become a full-stack, platform-capable builder.

You **do not** need to be an experienced developer.
You **do not** need a CS degree.
You **do not** need to know Rust, Python, TypeScript, or SQL before starting.

But you *should* have a certain level of technical comfort so the program is challenging but not overwhelming.

---

## Mindset prerequisites

### 1. You enjoy building things

If you like:

- creating small tools
- automating annoyances
- tinkering with code
- exploring new languages

…you’re in the right place.

### 2. You’re comfortable Googling and debugging

You don’t need to solve everything alone, but you should be willing to:

- search error messages
- read docs or answers
- try again after a failure

### 3. You want breadth, not just narrow expertise

Foundry90 covers:

- frontend
- backend
- databases
- data pipelines
- ops & deployment

The goal is **breadth + glue + judgment**, not “become a Rust-only or React-only engineer.”

## Technical prerequisites

### 1. Basic command line familiarity

If you can:

- navigate directories (`cd`, `ls`)
- run commands (`python script.py`, `cargo run`, `pnpm dev`)
- install tools

…you meet this requirement.

### 2. Basic programming fundamentals

You should understand:

- variables
- functions
- loops
- if/else logic
- reading simple code

This can come from **any language**:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C#
- C++
- etc.

If you’re truly brand new, do a 5–10 hour introductory course in Python or JavaScript first, then come back.

### 3. Comfortable editing files and using Git

You don’t need to be a Git pro, but you should:

- be able to clone a repo
- save changes and commit
- push to GitHub (optional but recommended)

Foundry90 will give guidance on structuring your repo, but you should already be ok with the idea of files, folders, and basic version control.

---

## Not required (seriously)

You **do NOT** need:

- to know Rust already
- to know TypeScript already
- to know Docker
- to know AWS
- to have deployed anything before

All of these will be introduced during the program.

---

## Highly recommended (but not mandatory)

These are not hard requirements, but they make the experience smoother:

- You’ve built at least one small project before (any language, any domain).
- You’re comfortable troubleshooting environment issues.
- You’re curious about how “real” systems work, not just toy scripts.
- You have a consistent block of time each week to work on this (e.g., 5–10 hours).

---

## If you’re unsure

Read the [Glossary](./glossary.md).

- If the vocabulary feels understandable and a bit exciting: you’re ready.
- If it feels overwhelming but not completely alien: you can still do this, just go slower.
- If everything sounds like a foreign language: do a smaller beginner course first, then come back to Foundry90.
