# Foundry90

Foundry90 is a 90-day systems engineering curriculum for builders who want to become full-stack, platform-capable engineers.

The program combines:

- Next.js + TypeScript (frontend + full-stack web)
- Rust (backend services)
- Python (ETL, data pipelines)
- Postgres + Redis (data + caching)
- Docker + AWS + Vercel (deployment & ops)
- SwiftUI (optional native client)

The goal is **breadth + glue + engineering judgment**, not just “learn a language.”

Everyone following Foundry90 builds **their own capstone project** – your implementation, your decisions.
